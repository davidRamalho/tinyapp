# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
For security features, the application contains basic user authentication and authorization, plus cookie encryption. 
Last, but not least, it contains memes and funny error messages!
